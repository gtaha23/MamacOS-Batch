# MamacOS
MamacOS is a fun little project for my batch skills. This is currently on moderation,
You can download the code and try it yourself! It is an Open-source project of script programs that thinks it is an "OS".

# Team
Me and my cousin decided to make this project on 13/06/2024! I was originally started this project 2 months ago.
Our teams name is based on the OS, the team name is MamaCode Studios.

# Updates

- Main file updated. 
- Minor bugs fixed.
- version_control commands updated!

# Prewiew
The "OS" or the scripts only needs less 25 KB of storage so you can test it with ease. Here is the oldfetch command from the v0.1.4 "OS" (User variable is blurred by G. Taha) ![MamacOS-resim](https://github.com/gtaha23/MamacOS-Batch/assets/159329966/9169fef7-8c39-4ea8-8349-ef6f08bb1264)
and another one one from v0.1.8 (sorry for the version commands showing v0.1.7) ![MamacOS](https://github.com/gtaha23/MamacOS-Batch/assets/159329966/f6b1ab8b-edfe-4451-b963-0ca0cbbc0cf0)


# Current Status
New release! v0.2. series released and added some cool cmd stuff, Created a small shell that can run any cmd commands, check out later for more updates.

# Fun facts
Why is the main file is named "Ders.bat"?
-> Because in my first batch experiences i named it that because
it is for my .bat lessons and it means "Work.bat" or "Lesson.bat" in english.

Why the name of OS and the team is based on the slang "Mamac"?
-> Because in my school i bringed the meme of "Fortinayti le Babaci" and they now call me a word like "Babaci" slang.
