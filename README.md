# Fun facts
Why is the main file is named "Ders.bat"?
-> Because in my first batch experiences i named it that because
it is for my .bat lessons and it means "Work.bat" or "Lesson.bat" in english.

Why the name of OS and the team is based on the slang "Mamac"?
-> Because in my school i bringed the meme of "Fortinayti le Babaci" and they now call me a word like "Babaci" slang.
